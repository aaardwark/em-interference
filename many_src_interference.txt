interference due to several point sources of radiation
here will assume that all sources emit the same single frequency
and that the radiation is uniform

$def point_src := position [x, y, z]; frequency; phase; luminosity;
    @def distance_t0 := point;
        >>> ...
        
    @def amplitude_at := point;
        >>> sqrt(luminosity) / distance_to(point)*sqrt(2πε0c)

    @def oscillation := point;
        >>> sinusoid(frequency, amplitude_at(point), phase)

$def sinusoid := frequency, amplitude, phase
    @def displacement := t;
        >>> amplitude * sin(2*pi*frequency*t - phase)
