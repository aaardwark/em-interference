givens: luminosity, L Watts & distance, r metres
to find: amplitude - the peak electric field strength, A = E

intensity I ∝ A^2  -->  I ∝ E^2  -->  I = kE^2

I = L/(4πr^2) Watts per metre squared

kE^2 = L/(4πr^2)
E = sqrt( L/(4kπr^2) )

k = ε0c/2 where ε0 is the permittivity of free space and c is the speed of light

E = sqrt( L/(2πε0c*r^2) )
E = sqrt(L/2πε0c) / r
